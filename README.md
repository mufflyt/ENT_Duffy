H0: The null hypothesis is that the number of ear, nose, and throat cases was the same before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ha:  The alternative is that the number of ear, nose, and throat cases decreased after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Question 1:  Was there a difference in the total number of ear, nose, and throat cases performed before and after the COVID-19 pandemic?
Question 2:  Was there a statistically significant decrease in ear, nose and throat cases before and after COVID-19 in one institution compared to another institution?  There are six instutions: CU (University of Colorado), UCSF (University of California San Francisco). Georgetown, Harvard, KU (University of Kansas), and LSU (Louisiana State University).  
Question 3:  If there was a difference in cases between institutions, was there a difference in the procedure type performed?  Examples of procedure type are head_neck_cancer, otology_audiology, facial_plastic_reconstructive_surgery, and General_peds.  
Question 4:  Overall, there is a difference in ENT case volume between the types of hospitals where university hospitals do a statistically larger number of cases than county, VA, or Children’s hospitals (p<0.01).  Was there a statistically significant decrease in the cases explained by the different types of hospitals?  (e.g., county, VA, university, or Children’s hospitals)
